Git: https://www.atlassian.com/git/glossary#commands

1. Configure git on local machine
    - git config --global user.name "your_username_on_github"
    - git config --global user.email "your_email@example.com"

2. Using git in your project
    - initialize an empty git repository. This is done once for every new project:
        - git init
    - stage your changes every time you want to track new changes to your work:
        - git add . or git add -A
    - commit your changes every time you stage your work(git add .), this saves your work to the local repository:
        - git commit -m "your commit message"
    - create a repository on github. this happens only once
    - connect the local repository to the remote repository. this also happens only once:
        - git remote add origin REMOTE-URL
    - push your changes:
        - for the first time in a new branch, "git push -u origin master"
        - you will get an authentication pop up, you can choose token or sign in with your browser
            - token: it has expiry date and you will have to create it every time it expires.
                - profile_pix > settings > developer settings > personal access token > generate new token
            - sign in with your browser: connects your vscode to your github account
        - consequently, you run "git push"
3. U: untracked/A: staged/M: modified
4. git status: tells us the state of our project whether it is being tracked, staged, commited or untracked
5. creating a branch and checking out into it:
    - create a branch
        - git branch branch_name
    - checkout into the branch
        - git checkout 
    - create a branch and check into it
        - git branch -d branch_name
    - pushing from a new branch for the first time
        - git push -u origin branch_name
    - consequent pushes
        - git push
8. git checkout
8. git merge
9. pulling from a branch
10. clone
11. fork
12. .gitignore file
13. conflict: Advanced git
